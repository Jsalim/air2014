REMBO paper: project data to fit the box Y. However, our data always seems to be in between â€“sqrt(d) and sqrt(d) anyway so projection is not necessary with the current data. We plan to implement projection to box Y as the data needs it.

Always runs for 1000 iteration right now, we should add convergence as a termination criterion eventually.

Constants a and b in the equation for beta: what should they be? Same for r in the same equation, and the length scale l (L).
