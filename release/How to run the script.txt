There are 2 main programs in this package.

1) Random Embedding in Bayesian Optimization
To run the REMBO, just type in your terminal:
python parisMain2.py (This is the latest version of REMBO)

You may also modify the source to run  REMBO with other settings (e.g. different values of d and k).
Open the parisMain2.py file and put your code there.
We kindly ask you to backup the file before you make any changes.

2) Random Embedding in DBGD
Before you can use this program, copy your data to lerot/DATA directory, and make sure the data is correctly loaded in these 2 files: experiment_lerot_rembo.py and compare_lerot_rembo.py

To run the REM-DBGD, follow this instruction below:

- go to lerot/src/scripts
- run python experiment_lerot_rembo.py. This command will run the experiment 1 and stores all results in txt files to the output directory.
- run python compare_lerot_rembo.py. This comman will run the experiment 2 which compares the original DBGD with REM-DBGD. You may change the value of d and k by editing the file before you run it.
