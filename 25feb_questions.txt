- how does the Y subset practically look? (step 2)

You usually choose it to be a box.
 
- does the Y subset from step 2 use the A-matrix from step 1?

No, you choose them independently of each other.
 
- how does DBGD make use of step 1 and step 2? Are we moving our smaller d dimensional feature vector to some direction and compare it to the old version using a click model?

Yes, you do DBGD in the subset Y, but you just do the interleaved comparisons between the rankers that the matrix A sends you to. So, whenever DBGD tells you to compare points x and y in Y, you look at the rankers Ax and Ay in X and do interleaved comparisons between these two rankers.
 
- how do you choose which features are d and which are D-d? So, if we have d=4, and y=[0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], which of the 64 features do we use y for?

The whole point of the random embedding algorithm is that you DON'T choose the features. You just randomly embed the low dimensional space into the high dimensional space.

Does this make sense?
